- Views are just for testing backend and practicing on blades.

- #### The dashboard template is cloned from Rashid Ali
    Source : https://github.com/realrashid/Todo-App
<br><br>

- #### All forms are extended from one which is downloaded from colorlib.com

- #### Note : I converted these HTML files into blades. Then I modified & reformed some parts to make them appropriate for the project
